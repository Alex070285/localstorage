# LocalStorage for .NET

## What is LocalStorage?
--------------------------------

LocalStorage is a simple utility that solves a common problem pragmatically - storing and accessing objects quickly in a .NET app. It is designed with a specific vision in mind: provide a **simple solution for persisting objects**, even between sessions, that is unobtrusive and requires zero configuration.

## Getting Started
--------------------------------

First, you might want to dive into the [examples in this document](#examples). Want more, have a look [at the tests](https://github.com/hanssens/localstorage-for-dotnet/tree/master/LocalStorage.Tests). 

Once you're game, simply add it to your project [through NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LocalStorage).

NuGet Package Manager: 

    $ Install-Package LocalStorage

NuGet CLI:

    $ nuget install LocalStorage

## If you've got an issue...
